"""THE one home for pressing a key in a page, and for proving the text landed.

F-873. ``type_text`` used to answer ``True`` for two things it had not done,
and both answers came from the same place: nothing here asked Chrome anything.

**What a key press is.** Every key this tool sends goes out as
``Input.dispatchKeyEvent`` with a ``keyDown``/``keyUp`` pair, and the
``keyDown`` carries ``text``. That is not decoration:

* nodriver's ``Element.send_keys`` dispatches a lone ``char`` event per
  character (``core/element.py:708``). A ``char`` commits the character —
  ``keypress`` and ``input`` fire, trusted — but ``keydown`` and ``keyup``
  never do, so a page whose autocomplete, shortcut or validation handling is
  bound to ``keydown`` (which is most of them) saw a value appear without a
  single key being pressed.
* Enter is the same key with ``text="\\r"``, and the ``text`` is the whole of
  it. A form's *implicit submission* is performed by Blink on the **keypress**,
  and only a ``keyDown`` carrying ``text`` makes Chrome synthesise one.
  Measured against a one-input form with a submit listener, Chrome 152:
  a page-constructed ``KeyboardEvent`` (``isTrusted: false``) -> 0 submits;
  ``rawKeyDown`` (trusted, no keypress) -> 0 submits; ``keyDown(text="\\r")``
  -> keydown + keypress + **1 submit**. Adding a separate ``char`` event on top
  produced a second keypress and **2 submits** — which is why :func:`press_key`
  sends exactly two events and never a third.

**What a success is.** :func:`verify_received` is the answer to "did the page
take it". It compares the element's own text against the baseline read just
before the characters went out, and a control that took every event and moved
nothing is a FAILURE that raises. Measured on the same Chrome, every key event
delivered and the value unchanged: ``readonly``, ``range``, ``color``. The tool
used to report all three as success. ``date`` is deliberately NOT in that list
or in the hint :func:`verify_received` raises: the local Chrome 152 build
refused digits into a ``<input type="date">``, but PR #110's gate measured all
three CI cells ACCEPTING them, so it is a build-dependent shape and naming it as
a known refusal would be a claim the evidence does not support.

The test is "did anything change", deliberately, and not "does it now contain
exactly what I typed": an input mask, an autocomplete that rewrites, a
``number`` field that normalises, a page that upper-cases — all of those DID
receive the input, and a stricter test would have turned each of them into a
new false alarm, which is the same defect wearing the opposite sign.

**No message here ever carries the text.** The field that refused may be a
password box, and a raised ``ToolError`` travels further than the caller: the
``section_tool`` wrapper hands every escaping exception to
``debug_logger.log_tool_failure`` (the in-memory ring — that entry point
deliberately withholds the durable line, F-782/F-835, precisely because a
failure message echoes the caller's own arguments), and the exception itself
goes on to the client and to Sentry. So every message here reports shape and
count only (the selector, how many characters were typed, how many the element
holds). Same discipline as F-869's storage reader, for the same reason.

A leaf: ``nodriver`` and ``tool_errors`` only. The tab and the element both
arrive as arguments.

"""The ``browser-management`` tools. See ``tool_sections/__init__.py`` for the contract.

plan_SERVERSPLIT slice 10 — the second-largest section and the one that owns the
BROWSER's own lifecycle: ``spawn_browser`` (the plan's largest single tool),
``close_instance``, the three history verbs and ``navigate``.

Two things make this section different from the nine before it, and both are
reasons the mechanism had to be proven elsewhere first:

* ``spawn_browser`` carries the F-808/F-810 headed-visibility guard, which runs
  BEFORE the ``try`` and outside it, so a spawn nobody could ever see refuses
  without first cloning a profile dir onto disk. It reads
  ``rt.display_context.display_context()`` for the refusal message and calls
  ``desktop_launch.can_deliver_headed_window()`` through a function-local import
  — both carried verbatim, including the local import, which is what keeps
  ``desktop_launch`` off this module's import graph.
* ``spawn_browser`` and ``close_instance`` are the two ends of the on-disk
  profile/clone lifecycle, so six of this module's calls land in
  ``rt.clone_storage`` — the disk subsystem, resolved at call time like every
  other singleton, which is what keeps
  ``tests/test_clone_storage.py``'s "patch it THERE, not on server" pin true of a
  body that no longer lives in ``server.py``.

Bodies moved verbatim: the only edits are the dropped registration decorator
(contract rule 2 — registration is driven from ``server.py``'s binding loop, once
per execution of that module body) and the rewrite of the singleton/knob reads to
``rt.<name>``, resolved at CALL time against the one patchable home (contract
rule 3). Docstrings and signatures are byte-identical — FastMCP surfaces them and
``tests/goldens/tool_surface.json`` is a HARD golden for this migration — and so
is ``get_instance_state``'s ``# F-164 non-CDP`` marker comment, which
``tests/test_cdp_timeout.py`` follows into this file through
``tests/source_scan.py``.

    Spawn a new browser instance.

    Args:
        headless (bool): Run in headless mode.
        user_agent (Optional[str]): Custom user agent string.
        viewport_width (int): Requested browser WINDOW width in pixels (outer, not
            the CSS viewport). Best-effort: a headed window is clamped to the work
            area of the LAUNCHING context's desktop — the user's monitor only when
            the backend runs on it (F-808), not the caller's screen — so a request
            larger than that desktop lands smaller.
        viewport_height (int): Requested browser WINDOW height in pixels, same
            best-effort clamping as viewport_width.
        proxy (Optional[str]): Proxy server URL.
        browser_args (List[str]): Additional browser launch args.
        timezone_id (Optional[str]): IANA timezone ID applied via CDP timezone override.
        idle_timeout_seconds (Optional[int]): Idle timeout override in seconds for automatic instance cleanup.
        block_resources (List[str]): List of resource types to block (e.g., ['image', 'font', 'stylesheet']).
        extra_headers (Dict[str, str]): Additional HTTP headers.
        session (Optional[str]): The NAME of a persistent browser session — THE
            one documented way to ask for a profile, and the only one to use.
            Leave UNSET for normal use: an unnamed spawn gets a disposable copy
            of the shared ``default`` session and deletes it as soon as the
            browser closes, so you never manage or clean up sessions. Set it
            only when the user has EXPLICITLY asked to keep a login: a named
            session is NOT auto-cleaned and persists on disk indefinitely, so
            treat creating one as a deliberate, space-consuming action, and do
            not invent names. ``session="default"`` opens the SHARED session
            itself — the profile every new session is seeded from and the one a
            human logs in to; it is reserved and is never a session of your own.
            A session is a NAME, not a path: pass ``user_data_dir`` to open a
            directory by path.
            A named session is never deleted by close_instance, by the clone GC,
            by `cleanup --apply` or by `kill-orphans`, and since F-888 its
            BROWSER survives the backend too: a
            backend that stops, restarts, heals or crashes leaves such a browser
            RUNNING, and it is RE-ATTACHED to over CDP rather than replaced, so a
            human's logged-in session is not lost. Two paths reach it and you need
            neither by name: a new backend adopts the browsers it finds recorded
            at its own startup (same instance_id as before), and spawning with a
            session a live browser still holds re-attaches to THAT browser
            instead of walking to a sibling directory — and since F-931 so does a
            spawn naming NOTHING, which lands on ``default``. Either way the answer
            carries ``spawn_diagnostics["reattached"]: true`` plus the holder's
            pid, and the page is the one that was already open — not a fresh tab
            on the same cookies. A spawn naming nothing is never handed a browser
            THIS backend already drives, though: it asked for a browser of its
            own, so it gets a new session copied from the seed, with that
            browser's live cookies handed over. So to recover a logged-in browser whose backend
            died, just spawn with the same session. On that path the
            arguments that describe a LAUNCH cannot apply to a browser already
            running: headless, user_agent, viewport, proxy, browser_args,
            timezone_id and extra_headers are IGNORED rather than refused, and the
            ones you passed are listed in
            ``spawn_diagnostics["ignored_spawn_args"]`` — refusing over a viewport
            would send the spawn to a different directory and lose the login.
            ``block_resources`` IS applied. What the dead backend held and nobody
            can read back off a running browser is named in
            ``spawn_diagnostics["not_restored"]``. The one case that refuses is a
            browser this backend does not DRIVE — another backend's Chrome, or
            the human's own — because its cookies can only come over a CDP
            connection of ours and there is none: a copy of a profile Chrome is
            writing to carries none of them. Since F-915 that REFUSES the whole
            spawn rather than starting a new browser beside it. Nothing is
            created, that browser is left running and untouched, and the error
            names the holder and both ways on — close it (``stealthy close``, or
            stop the backend that owns it: RUNBOOK, "Recover a stranded login")
            and spawn again, or pass a free ``session`` name for a new session
            of your own.
        seed_from (Optional[str]): The NAME of an existing session to copy when
            ``session`` names one that does not exist yet — so a new session
            starts with that session's cookies and logins instead of the
            shared ``default`` session's. Leave UNSET for normal use; unset
            means ``default``, which is exactly what every session has always
            been seeded from.
            It applies ONLY at creation: passing it with a ``session`` that
            already exists is an ERROR naming where that session was actually
            seeded from, never a silent no-op and never a re-seed — opening a
            session keeps what it holds, and overwriting a login a human typed
            by hand is not something a flag should be able to do by accident.
            It needs a ``session`` of its own, so it is also an error with no
            ``session`` or with ``session="default"``.
            The source must EXIST. It MAY be open in a browser, but only one
            THIS backend drives — a session you spawned through this tool, the
            common case after ``spawn --session work --headed`` and a hand
            login. Then its COOKIES are read out of the running browser over
            CDP and written into the new session, and the answer says so:
            ``seeded_via: "cdp-cookies"`` plus counts. A source held by a
            browser this backend does not drive (another backend's, or a Chrome
            nobody here launched) is refused BY NAME, because there is no
            connection of ours to ask for its cookies and a file copy of a live
            profile carries none at all — the jar is held open and skipped, and
            nothing can say afterwards what was lost.
            ``default`` — the value an UNSET ``seed_from`` means — has its own
            three outcomes, because it is the session a human logs in to and
            its window is normally still open. The copy always comes from the
            seed, a separate closed copy of it, and never from the live
            directory. If this backend is driving that window, the live jar is
            handed over on top of that copy, exactly as for a named source
            (``seeded_via: "cdp-cookies"``) — which matters because the seed is
            NOT refreshed while ``default`` is open, so the copy alone can be
            days old. If a Chrome we do not drive holds it, the copy happens
            anyway and nothing is refused; the answer's ``seed_changed_since``
            says the seed is behind. The only refusal is a machine with no seed
            yet AND ``default`` open, where the only available copy would be of
            the live directory: nothing is created, and closing that window
            once writes the seed.
            WHAT A HAND-OFF CARRIES IS COOKIES AND NOTHING ELSE: every kind
            (session, persistent, HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=None and
            Partitioned), and the WHOLE jar — every site that session is logged
            into, not just the one you had in mind. It does NOT carry
            ``localStorage``, ``sessionStorage``, IndexedDB, Cache Storage, any
            service-worker registration, or saved passwords/autofill. A site
            that keeps its token in ``localStorage`` will NOT be logged in.
            Those stores come across only from a source that is CLOSED, where
            the file copy can read them — with the one exception that a session
            cookie is never on disk at all and so only ever arrives this way.
            If the hand-off fails the session is still created and still works;
            the answer then says ``seeded_via: "copy"`` with
            ``cookie_handoff_error``.
            The other exception is ``default`` itself, whose copyable form the
            product maintains separately, so seeding from it works whether or
            not it is open (that copy can be as old as the last time ``default``
            was closed, which the answer reports as ``seed_changed_since``).
            What the new session records is the source's NAME:
            ``spawn_diagnostics["profile_selection"]["seeded_from"]``, a word
            you can pass straight back as ``session=``.
        user_data_dir (Optional[str]): DEPRECATED, and the ONE thing it still
            buys you is an absolute PATH, which ``session`` refuses. For a name
            it resolves to exactly the same profile ``session`` does — it is the
            same argument under the older word, not a second one — so passing
            both with DIFFERENT values is an error rather than a precedence you
            cannot see. Everything said about ``session`` above applies to it.
        sandbox (Optional[Any]): Enable browser sandbox. Accepts bool, string ('true'/'false'), int (1/0), or None for auto-detect.
        humanize (bool): Fork feature (embedded/humanize.py). When True,
            every click_element and type_text call on THIS instance moves the
            mouse along a curved path and paces keystrokes from quantile
            tables sampled from a real recorded human session, instead of an
            instant coordinate click and a fixed per-character delay. Off by
            default; set at spawn time and applies to the whole instance.

    Network interception captures request/response metadata by default, but
    response *bodies* are NOT stored unless capture is enabled — via
    set_network_capture_filters(capture_bodies=True) or
    STEALTH_MCP_NETWORK_CAPTURE_BODIES=1 (F-605, off by default). When on, the
    body store is byte-bounded (STEALTH_MCP_NETWORK_BODY_MAX_BYTES per body,
    STEALTH_MCP_NETWORK_BODY_STORE_MAX_BYTES total). get_response_content
    live-refetches a body on demand regardless of this setting.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: Instance information including instance_id. ``viewport`` is
        the window size Chrome ACTUALLY produced (measured post-launch, F-804), not
        an echo of the request; ``spawn_diagnostics["window_size"]`` carries
        ``requested``/``actual``/``inner_viewport``/``clamped`` so a size the OS
        overrode is visible rather than silent.

    # FIRST of the two pre-flight guards, and outside the try, for three reasons

    # with a browser on it — the exact state F-893 is about — was ADOPTED and the
    # resolver, which is where the reservation used to be asked, never saw the
    # request. A caller-input refusal raised inside the try would be re-wrapped by
    # the handler as "Failed to spawn browser: …", which is the wrong label for a
    # request we declined to act on at all. And it sits AHEAD of the F-808 guard
    # below because a refusal about what the CALLER ASKED FOR outranks one about
    # what THIS HOST can do: a reserved path is refused on every machine there is,
    # while "no desktop here" is a fact about this backend, and a caller told the
    # second about a request that fails the first goes looking for a display they
    # do not need. Measured: every headless CI cell answered the F-808 message for
    # a reserved snapshot path, so the reservation was unreachable there. Neither

    """Hand the live source's cookie jar to the session just spawned (F-898).

    ``{}`` for every spawn but the one the resolver marked, which is the branch
    that actually COPIED from a session whose browser THIS backend drives. The
    selection key carries the source DIRECTORY and is dropped before the
    caller ever sees it (``clone_storage._public_profile_selection``); what the
    caller is told is ``seeded_via`` and counts.

    **Why this is not a ``ToolError``.** The new session exists, its browser is
    running and everything a file copy could carry is in it — what failed is an
    augmentation. Raising would take a working session away from the caller and
    leave a directory on disk that a retry would then refuse as "already
    exists" (``profile_source.require_new_session``'s fourth refusal), i.e. the
    worst of both. So the failure is REPORTED, in the one field a caller reads
    about where this session came from, and the word is the mechanism that did
    run: ``seeded_via: "copy"``, which is true and is exactly what 2.1.12 would
    have refused to give them at all.

    **The source is re-derived rather than reused** from the pre-flight
    snapshot: a whole browser launch has happened since, and whether that
    browser is still ours is a fact with a lifetime. A source that closed in
    the meantime reports no instance and takes the same reported path as any
    other failure.

    **No cookie name or value reaches the log** — ``cookie_handoff.failure``
    repeats the text of a ``HandoffError`` (which that module wrote, and which
    is shape only) and reports anything else by its TYPE alone; and the warning
    deliberately does NOT pass ``error=exc``: that forwards ``exc_info``, and
    the exception behind a failed ``Storage.setCookies`` is Chrome's answer to a
    command whose parameters were the jar itself. This is the one place in the
    tree where F-869's convenience is declined on purpose, and it is declined
    because the payload here is credentials rather than page shape.

    **The timeout's ``raise … from None`` is the one place that discipline does
    NOT apply, and it says so rather than being copied** (review N2). What it
    suppresses is a ``ToolError`` THIS TREE wrote — ``rt._with_cdp_timeout``'s,
    whose text names a budget and an instance id and can never name a cookie —
    so unlike ``cookie_handoff._step``'s identical-looking line it is not
    hiding a payload, and the reason is simply that the replacement says
    strictly more than the thing it replaces. Keeping the chain would cost
    nothing either: the ``HandoffError`` is caught by the handler two lines
    below, which reads ``failure(exc)`` and never a ``__context__``, so no
    traceback is built from it. ``from None`` is written for the READER — this
    module raises three ``HandoffError``s here and a chained one among them
    would invite exactly the question of whether Chrome's answer travels with
    it.

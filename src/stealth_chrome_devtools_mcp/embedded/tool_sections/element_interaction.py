"""The ``element-interaction`` tools. See ``tool_sections/__init__.py`` for the contract.

plan_SERVERSPLIT slice 11 — the LAST section to leave ``server.py`` and the
largest: twelve bodies covering every way a caller touches the page (query,
click, type, paste, select, upload, scroll, wait, read and screenshot) plus
``execute_script``, the default exec-family tool.

``execute_script`` is why this section went last. It is the only body that reads
THREE runtime knobs at once — ``rt._script_rejection_reason`` (and through it
``MAX_USER_SCRIPT_BYTES``), ``rt.EXECUTE_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT`` and
``rt._clamp_timeout`` — and every one of them is resolved against
``tool_runtime`` at CALL time, which is what keeps
``tests/conftest.py``'s ``patched_server`` reaching a guard whose body no longer
lives in ``server.py``. The guard itself never moved: it has lived in
``tool_runtime`` since slice 0, so what this slice proves is the LAST caller
reaching it from a section module.

With this slice ``server.py`` holds no tool bodies at all — only ``mcp``, the
registry, ``app_lifespan``, the four ``@mcp.resource`` handlers, the binding loop
that registers all 94 of these functions once per execution of its module body,
the xpool-safe gate, ``build_arg_parser`` and the ``__main__`` block, plus the
migration alias block slice 12 deletes.

Bodies moved verbatim: the only edits are the dropped registration decorator
(contract rule 2) and the rewrite of the singleton/knob reads to ``rt.<name>``
(contract rule 3). Docstrings and signatures are byte-identical — FastMCP
surfaces them and ``tests/goldens/tool_surface.json`` is a HARD golden for this
migration — and so are ``take_screenshot``'s two function-local imports (``io``
and ``PIL.Image``), carried as they stood rather than hoisted, because hoisting
them would put Pillow on this module's import graph at binding time.

    Execute JavaScript source in the active page and return its value.

    The default exec-family tool; prefer a sibling when it fits — `inject_and_execute_script`
    (specific execution context), `call_javascript_function`/`execute_function_sequence`
    (invoke defined functions), `execute_python_in_browser` (Python), `execute_cdp_command` (raw CDP).

    ASYNC IS SUPPORTED (F-883). Top-level `await` works, and a Promise the script
    returns is awaited for you and answered with the value it resolves to:
    `return fetch(u).then(r => r.text())` and
    `const d = await (await fetch(u)).json(); return d.id;` both give you the data.
    A Promise that REJECTS raises with its reason — it is never reported as a
    success. A script that never settles is killed at `timeout_ms`, exactly like a
    blocking one; a Promise that settles AFTER `timeout_ms` is discarded and the
    instance stays usable. Note the flip side: a TRAILING expression that is a
    Promise is now awaited too — `fetch('/slow')` as the last statement blocks up
    to `timeout_ms` where it used to answer `{}` at once; write `void fetch(...)`
    for fire-and-forget. (Before this fix a returned Promise came back as `{}`
    and a rejection as `{}` with `success: true`.)

    ⚠️ Non-blocking code only. The script runs on the page's main thread, so
    anything that blocks it freezes the whole tab and makes every later call time
    out. Specifically:
      • NEVER use synchronous XHR — `xhr.open(url, false)`. Use `await fetch(url)`.
      • NEVER use infinite/blocking loops — `while(true)`, `for(;;)`, busy-waits.
      • NEVER call `alert()` / `confirm()` / `prompt()` — they block automation.
      • To UPLOAD FILES, use the `upload_file` tool — do NOT fetch blobs or build
        base64/DataTransfer here (mixed-content/CORS limits and can freeze the page).
      • Keep scripts small (< ~100KB); don't inline large payloads.

    A top-level `var` / `function` declaration still lands on the page: the source
    is evaluated as written first, and only Chrome's own "illegal return" /
    "await is only valid in async functions" complaint sends it round again inside
    an async wrapper.

        script (str): JavaScript to execute; non-blocking. Top-level 'return' and
